        Individual assignment Minor Data-Driven Decision Making
      </h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Objective: Enhance your understanding and application of data driven
        decision making through a curated selection of videos, leading to the
        development of a minimum viable data product.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        We have carefully selected an extensive collection of videos to deepen
        your knowledge in various key areas of data driven decision making,
        including machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analysis,
        visualization, application development, cutting-edge technologies,
        specialized applications, and quality assurance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Assignment Details</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Exploration:</strong> Begin your journey by exploring our
          curated collection of videos.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Selection:</strong> Choose at least one video that resonates
          with your interests or curiosities. This video will serve as the
          cornerstone of your exploration journey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In-depth Study:</strong> Dive deep into the topic of the
          selected video. Understand the methodologies, technologies, and
          concepts discussed. This phase is crucial for building a solid
          foundation for your project.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identify a Real-world Problem:</strong> Inspired by the
          suggestion to make this assignment more applied, we encourage you to
          identify a real-world problem. This problem could be something you've
          encountered during an internship, in your studies, or even in your
          personal life. The problem should be relevant to the themes covered in
          your selected video and should be solvable using the methodologies
          that are discussed in the video.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Develop a Data Product:</strong> Utilizing the knowledge and
          insights gained from your selected video and in-depth study, develop a
          minimum viable data product that addresses the identified problem.
          Your data product could be a model, an application, a visualization,
          or any other form of data-driven solution that offers a practical
          resolution to the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Presentation:</strong> Conclude your assignment by preparing a
          presentation of your data product. This presentation should not only
          showcase your final product but also detail the journey you undertook
          to get there, including how the video inspired your approach, the
          problem-solving process, and the application of learned methodologies.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Deliverables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A detailed report on your exploration journey, including the rationale
          behind your video selection and an in-depth analysis of topics covered
          in the chosen video.
        </li>
        <li>
          A comprehensive description of the identified problem and why it is
          significant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Documentation of your data product development process, including data
          sources, methodologies, and technologies used.
        </li>

          (max. 10 minutes) containing your final presentation showcasing your
          data product and its potential impact on solving the identified
          problem. The video should be uploaded to YouTube and the link should
          be shared with the instructors. If you don noy want to make your video
          publicly available, you can set it to unlisted.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This assignment is an opportunity to not only deepen your understanding
        of data driven decision making but also to apply your skills in a
        meaningful way. We encourage creativity, critical thinking, and a
        problem-solving mindset throughout this journey. Good luck!
